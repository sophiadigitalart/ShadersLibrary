    The Two tweets challenge 2015 is over.

    An overwhelming amount of great stuff has been submitted in
    the past 2 weeks, I was expecting maybe a dozen entries and
    we are at 105 at the time of this writing.

    Thanks to everyone who participated and helped make this
    fun and interesting.



    Judging:
        Fow anyone who wants to help with judging, you can
        send you top 5 picks in order (from #1 to #5, best being #1)
        via email at: nimitzstg at gmail.com
        Anyone who participated in the tournament can
        be a judge, just let me know what's your shadertoy
        username in the email. Only restriction is you can't
        vote for your own shaders and you must send exactly
        5 picks. You can vote for multiple shaders of a single
        user in your top 5.

    TLDR:
        -Send your top 5 shaders in order from best to worst
        -Don't vote for yourself
        -Mention your shadertoy username
        -You can vote for multiple shaders of a single user

    Points Calculation:
        Every judge has the same voting weight, your
        first pick gets 1 point, second 0.75 points,
        third 0.5625 points and so on (n+1 = n*0.75).
        Winners are the shaders with most points.

        z += abs(sin(vec4(9,0,1,1)+(o.y + t + o.w)))*.12*c/(o.w*o.w+ 6.5);
    gl_FragColor = z*z*z;
